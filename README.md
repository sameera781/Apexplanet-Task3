TASK 1 – Apply Responsive Design Using Media Queries

Objective: Ensure that web pages look great on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
Description:

Responsive web design makes sure a website adapts to different screen sizes.

Using CSS media queries, layouts, font sizes, and images adjust automatically.

Example: On a desktop, text can be larger and multiple columns can be shown, while on a mobile, the layout stacks vertically for easy reading.

Importance:

Enhances user experience on all devices.

Reduces the need to build separate apps for mobile.

Improves SEO ranking (Google favors mobile-friendly sites).

TASK 2 – Build an Interactive Quiz or Image Carousel

Objective: Use JavaScript to make the webpage more interactive.

Option A: Interactive Quiz

Users answer multiple-choice questions.

JavaScript checks the answers and displays results dynamically.

Helps in learning applications, surveys, or fun knowledge tests.

Option B: Image Carousel

Displays multiple images in a sliding format.

Users can click Next/Prev buttons or images rotate automatically.

Commonly used in e-commerce, portfolios, or product showcases.

Importance:

Makes the website engaging.

Demonstrates event handling, DOM manipulation, and logic building in JavaScript.

TASK 3 – Work with External APIs

Objective: Learn how to fetch and display real-time data from a public API.

Description:

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow a website to connect with external services.

Example: Fetching data from a weather API to show live temperature, or from a joke API to display random jokes.

JavaScript’s fetch() method or async/await is used to request and handle the data.

Importance:

Adds real-world functionality to websites.

Makes applications dynamic instead of static.

Helps in creating apps like news feeds, weather apps, stock trackers, and chatbots.

✅ In short:

Task 1 → Focus on design & layout (CSS + media queries).

Task 2 → Focus on interactivity (JavaScript logic).

Task 3 → Focus on real-world data integration (APIs).
